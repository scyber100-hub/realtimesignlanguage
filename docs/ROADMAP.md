# ROADMAP

Short-term items suggested for next iterations. Each item is tracked as a GitHub issue.

## API & Docs
- [ ] Refactor README API section into a structured table (endpoint, method, auth, description)

## Dashboard
- [ ] Style polish (colors/spacing) and legend for alert types & thresholds
- [ ] Show current thresholds alongside badges/panel

## Server
- [ ] Add session-scoped event summary endpoint (e.g., `GET /events/summary/by_session`)
- [ ] Optional rolling-window percentiles for latency (1m/5m) in `/stats`

## Repo
- [ ] Consider enabling auto-merge (squash) in repository settings and re-try PR auto-merge
